### Customer Churn Analysis 
### 📌 Overview

- I built a Customer Churn Analysis Dashboard using Power BI to understand why customers leave a telecom service. The project focuses on identifying churn patterns, key factors influencing churn, and customer segments with high churn risk. This helps businesses take preventive actions to retain customers.

### 🎯 Objectives

- Analyze customer demographics, services, and subscription details
- Identify why customers churn and which groups are at higher risk
- Study billing, contract type, and payment behavior
- Visualize churn patterns using interactive Power BI dashboards
- Help businesses make data-driven decisions to reduce churn

- DAX – Measures & calculated columns
- Excel / CSV Dataset – Source data
- Power Query – Data cleaning & transformation
